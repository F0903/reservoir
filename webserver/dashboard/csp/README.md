# CSP Generator

This little package generates a CSP header with the hashes of inline scripts and styles in the dashboard index.html artifact.

If you get an error from Go about missing symbols in this directory, run `go generate` in this directory, or alternatively just build the whole project as normal and the generation will be done automatically.
