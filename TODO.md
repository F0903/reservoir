A file to track all the things that need to be done in the project.

A '(?)' at the end of a line indicates a possible future feature or idea.

- Custom scrollbar (was spoiled by Zen's beautiful default scrollbar)
- More performance metrics
- Log coloring / better readability
- Rewrite caching to store in memory, and evict to disk when necessary
- More tests
- Mobile support
- Content-Type Specific Handling (?)
